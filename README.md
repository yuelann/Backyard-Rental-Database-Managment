# Backyard-Rental-Database-Managment

CapiFun is a peer-to-peer rental service, facilitating yard rentals through a user-friendly app. Revenue is generated via a small commission on transactions. Users can connect, chat, and finalize deals through the app.

Yard owners provide details, including date, time, location, size, and amenities. Renters filter options based on preferences, such as location, size, and amenities. Yard ratings impact pricing, and users can rate their experiences.

A centralized database streamlines user data, rental agreements, and filters, ensuring easy retrieval and aggregation. Users register, specify roles (renter or rentee), and post or filter rental opportunities.

Renters can inspect yards before acceptance, and mutual approval is required to finalize rentals. Strict time constraints, cleaning requirements, and cancellation policies are enforced. Compliance with filters is crucial for positive ratings and perceptions.

CapiFun serves everyday individuals seeking yard rentals for various events, promoting unity and efficiency in the renting process.
